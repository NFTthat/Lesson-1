# Lesson-1
Learning HTML (Ending Project)

My thoughts on the entire class period:
I really think Dave Gray is such an amazing tutor, learn from his 4hours HTML course on YT, it was really understanding and easy to grap. I highly recomend it if if you are just starting. <a href="https://youtu.be/mJgBOIoGihA?si=0CMx6cqpDR8ESUtC">The course is 1year old</a>

HTML is really an amazing langauge even thought i know many pros don't consider it to be a programming language, but cmon lets enjoying our starting point. 
What really got my excited was know the fact that this is how every sites is being started and becoming what millions interact with.

In this Project i used everything i learned in one way or the other:
Meta Data,
Links,
Elements,
Semantic Rules,
Tables, and 
Forms to mention the majors.

This project will help you pratice everything you'd learning if you take the class and even taking the next steps in commiting it. Good luck :)
